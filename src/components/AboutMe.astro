      About me
    </h2>

    <p class="text-lg leading-7 text-pretty">
      Hello! I&apos;m Leon, a Full Stack Developer with 2+ years of hands&#45;on
      experience turning ideas into web applications and SaaS products. I
      started my career at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, where I grew
      from a junior developer into a team lead—mentoring peers, managing
      projects, and delivering solutions that improved workflows and user
      experiences. As a co&#45;founder of a restaurant&#45;management startup,
      I&apos;ve worn many hats: architecting features, coordinating with
      stakeholders, and ensuring smooth deployments. <br />This journey has
      sharpened my problem&#45;solving, leadership, and communication skills,
      and taught me how to guide projects from concept to launch. I&apos;m
      passionate about collaborating with both private clients and enterprises
      to create custom, impactful solutions. I thrive in agile teams, embrace
      continuous learning, and always aim to exceed expectations. Let&apos;s
      work together to bring your next project to life!
